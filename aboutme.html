	<p>Hi my name is Tiancheng Wu and I am currently a Computer Science major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and originally from China.</p>

	In high school, I tutor Math and compete in CS and Chem Computetitions.
	My hobbies include photography and gaming. Fun fact: I share my nickname with the Main Charater in the Matrix.</p>
	
	<p>While at UIUC, I am interested in joining ACM SigMobile (an ACM special interest group for mobile development). I look forward to making new friends from all over the world! </p>
	
	<p>	Take a second to look at my <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/illinois.edu/document/d/132fUiToPlasj_s5tX_AH5Jp6Brl4ds4IinWIWyOIE8Y/edit?usp=sharing">resume</a>!</p>
